Problems
X <- c(1,4,3,2,5,4,3,6,7,8)
Y <- c(1,3,6,7,8,2,8,7,6,9)
1. An X and Y variable contain the above numbers.

A. Compute Pearsonâ€™s r and report the associated p-value using the cor.test() function. (2 points)
```{r}

```

B. Use a permutation test to create a null-distribution, and report the p-value for getting the observed correlation or larger using your simulated null-distribution. (2 points)

2. Using the variables X and Y above, and assuming that the values could be re-ordered in any way, report the following:

A. the smallest possible sum of cross-products (1 point)

B. the largest possible sum of cross-products (1 point)
