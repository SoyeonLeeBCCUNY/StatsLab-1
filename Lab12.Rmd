1. Should you do a linear regression on this data? Explain.
```{r}
# The below calculation indicated no relationship between the two variables (correlation is 0) because correlation measures how points fit in a straight line. The calculated value is deceiving because we see a perfect relationship between the two vectors when we plot the data.  Y seems to be a function of an absolute value of X, but we cannot use a simple linear regression since this is an absolute value function.  

Y <- c(10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
X <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19)

some_data<-data.frame(X_iv=X, Y_dv=Y)
cor.test(some_data$Y_dv,some_data$X_iv)

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(some_data, aes(x=X_iv, y=Y_dv))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method='lm', se=FALSE)

```
